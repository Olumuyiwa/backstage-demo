#  The Dockerfile is divided into two stages: 
 
#  Build Stage:  This stage is responsible for installing the necessary dependencies, building the Backstage backend, and copying the built backend to the runtime stage. 
#  Runtime Stage:  This stage is responsible for running the Backstage backend. 
 
#  The  build  stage uses the  node:20-alpine  image as the base image. It installs the necessary dependencies for native modules, copies the  package.json  and  yarn.lock  files, installs the production dependencies, and builds the Backstage backend. 
#  The  runtime  stage uses the  node:20-alpine  image as the base image. It copies the built backend from the  build  stage, the  node_modules  directory, the  app-config*.yaml  files, and the  package.json  file. It sets the necessary environment variables and runs the Backstage application. 
#  The  Dockerfile  is now ready. 
#  Step 4: Build the Docker Image 
#  To build the Docker image, run the following command: 
#  docker build -t backstage-app .
 
#  This command builds the Docker image with the name  backstage-app . 
#  Step 5: Run the Docker Container 
#  To run the Docker container, run the following command: 
#  docker run -d -p 8080:8080 backstage-app
 
#  This command runs the Docker container in detached mode and maps port  8080  of the host machine to port  8080  of the container. 
#  Step 6: Access the Backstage Application 
#  To access the Backstage application, open a web browser and navigate to  http://localhost:8080 . 
#  Conclusion 
#  You now have a Backstage application running in a Docker container. You can now customize the application by adding plugins, components, and more. 
#  Happy coding!
